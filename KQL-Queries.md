I will be placing [KQL Queries](https://github.com/mattnovitsch/M365/tree/main/KQL) in this section for the following Defender Product lines:

* Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
* Microsoft Defender for Identity
* Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
* Microsoft Defender for Office

I will have folders with each of the areas tagged queries. Right now, I just have MDE and MDI. I will post more as I keep diving deeper into the products and I get more requests from customers asking for things.
