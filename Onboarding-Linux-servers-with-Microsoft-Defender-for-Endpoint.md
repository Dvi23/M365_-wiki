5.	Open an Administrative PowerShell.
6.	We will use the SCP command to upload the py script to the Linux Server: <BR>
`scp -P 22 .\MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py <username>@<IP Address or servername>:/home/<username>/Desktop/`<BR>
â€¢	It should prompt you for your password. <BR>

7.	Check and/or Install Python. <BR>
`python --version`<BR>
`sudo dnf install python3`
7.	Install MDE<BR>
`sudo yum install mdatp`
8.	Change directory to the location where you placed the onboarding package.<BR>
`cd Desktop`
9.	Run the python script to create the onboarding package.<BR>
`sudo python MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py`
10.	Check the MDE client is pointing to your tenant: <BR>
`mdatp health --field org_id`
 
11.	You should see your OrgID returned, if you do then you are complete. It should show up in the console within 15 minutes to a couple of hours(mine were both in 15 minutes).

## Troubleshooting Steps:
If you need to turn off or uninstall MDE from the device:
* For Uninstall: `sudo yum remove mdatp`
* For stopping the service: `sudo service mdatp stop`
* For restarting the service:`sudo service mdatp restart`

## Next Steps:
Now that we have the Linux device onboarded with MDE, we need to push policies to them. Please see the next section: [How to push policy to Linux devices from Intune](https://github.com/mattnovitsch/M365/wiki/How-to-push-policy-to-Linux-devices-from-Intune)
