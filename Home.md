Welcome to my wiki Page, I'll be hosting my projects here that I have done for M365. I have been working with Microsoft Defender for Endpoints and Microsoft Endpoint Manager. I have about 20 years experience in the Information Technology field most of which has been around endpoint management.

If you need assistance with deployment of Microsoft 365 services you can put in a request for assistance at [Fast Track](http://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack). Fast Track can walk you through the process.
